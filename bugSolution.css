To resolve this specificity issue, one should use more specific class selectors or adjust the order of the CSS rules.  One possible solution is to refactor the CSS to use a more specific class selector that combines the class and ID, improving clarity and avoiding specificity issues. Alternatively, the order of rules within the CSS file could be altered to prioritize the class rules when necessary.
