The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors.  The `#id` selector has higher specificity than the class selector `.class`, so the rule applied to `#id` will override the rule set for `.class`, even though it is declared later. This might lead to unexpected visual outcomes if not understood.
